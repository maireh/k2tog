# k2tog

k2tog is a shared project between Erin Heyming and Maire Howard.

Erin and Maire are bringing up our knit2together.us site using Hugo. Our target user is a beginning knitter. Over time we will taylor it more and more as a knitting site that integrates well with Ravelry.

We are starting with the Academic theme even though this is not likely to be our final theme.

I have copyrighted the images specific to knit2together. Contact us if you want to use them.
