# What is Stockinette
When you think of a knit garment, you probably have something like this in mind:


This is actually stockinette stitch, which is a stitch pattern that produces Vs on one side and bumps on the other. The V side is usually the "front" (a.k.a. "public") side of the garment, meaning the side that people would see while you wear it.

Back side of stockinette:

The V side is the "knit" side, and the bumpy side is the "purl" side.
