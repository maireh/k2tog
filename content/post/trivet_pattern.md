# Introduction

The first stitch you need to learn is the "knit" stitch. Aptly named, it produces the row of "V"s we think of when we imagine a knit garment. The back of the knit stitch has a bump called a purl bump.

Most garments have only knit stitches on the "right" side of the garment -- the side facing out. This stitch combination is called "stockinette".
<!--TODO: add image of stockinette front and back-->

However, to achieve this look when knitting a flat piece, you'd knit one row, turn your piece over, then work the next row with purl stitches. A purl stitch is the opposite of the knit stitch -- it produces a bump on the side you're working and a "V" on the other side.

If you knit one row, turn your work and knit the next row, you'll end up with a squishy bumpy look. This stitch combination is called "garter".
<!--TODO: add image of garter-->

So while stockinette is a good traditional stitch, we're going to focus on garter stitch for your first project. This will give you a lot of practice with the knit stitch before you learn the purl stitch.

For this project you will use the following techniques to create a square trivet:

* long tail cast-on
* knit stitch
* bind-off

# What you'll need

## Yarn

* Wool or cotton medium weight yarn
<!--TODO: calculate amount-->

We will use wool or cotton yarn to withstand the heat a trivet experiences. If you choose wool, you'll have the added benefit of it being naturally flame-retardant. Cotton yarn and super-wash wool yarn will be machine washable. If you choose untreated wool yarn, you can still machine wash your trivet, but it will shrink and become more dense -- a process called felting (a fun project to try).

We're using a medium weight yarn because it's a good size to learn with -- not too thin and not too bulky. When you look at the yarn label, you may see it called worsted, afghan, aran, or size 4 with this symbol:

## Needles

* Size US 8 / 5.0mm knitting needles

The needle size you choose should be close to the size recommended on the label that comes with your yarn (if there's no label and it's a medium weight yarn, stay close to size 8 needles).

There are many types of needles on the market -- straight needles and circular needles made of a variety of materials, including wood and metal. Circular needles can be used to make round garments, but you can knit flat on them as well. You can buy a set of needles in many sizes and even interchangeable circular needles, which allow you to swap needle sizes with cable lengths. The specific needle you choose for this project is up to you -- they will all get the job done.

# The Pattern

## Abreviated pattern

<!--TODO: get this and the following sections to format better so we don't need bulleted lists-->
* CO 30 sts.
* K*
* Repeat last row until you've produced a square.
* BO all stitches

### Abbreviations

* CO = Cast On
* K = Knit
* BO = Bind Off

## Same pattern with explanations
<!--TODO: explain more or link to better explanations here-->

* Use the long tail cast on technique to cast on 30 stitches.
* For each row, knit all of the stitches until you've knit up a square. One way to tell if it's a square is to fold it in half diagonally. Here's what it looks like when it's not yet a square:

And here's what it looks like when you're ready to bind off:

* Bind off all of the stitches.
* Weave in the two yarn ends.

# Variations

You can change this pattern up:
<!--TODO: add in links for color changes and felting-->

* learn how to switch colors
* learn the purl stitch and alternate knits and purls to create the [seed stitch](http://www.dummies.com/crafts/knitting/designs-patterns/how-to-knit-the-seed-stitch/)
* use untreated wool then wash it in the washing machine to felt it
* make a double-thick version suitable as a potholder: knit two trivets the same size and sew up the sides with a tapestry needle and yarn. 
* don't stop when it's a square. If you keep going you can make a scarf. In this case, you can choose any type of yarn since it won't be touching a hot pan.
