# About Knit 2 Together

We're a mom and daughter team aiming to build up your knitting repertoire with a variety of patterns to help you learn new skills and techniques.

Each pattern states the techniques you should already know (techniques that we teach in other patterns) as well as techniques you will learn in the pattern. You can progress through our patterns to expand your knitting knowledge. Our aim is to be very clear so a knitter of any level can successfully finish our projects.

We are close to beginners ourselves, so we have a unique insight into what might cause other beginners to stumble. We help you through each new technique so you will feel confident.
